/**
 * Sword Finisher ability for Player.
 * Activated by input tag YH.Combat.Ability.SwordFinisher, which is fired by the combo manager when the player reaches the max combo count.
 * 
 * Flow:
 * 1. Activated by combo manager when player reaches max combo count.
 * 2. Plays finisher montage, which has a notify to apply the finisher damage effect at the right moment.
 * 3. Applies finisher damage effect to enemies in range, which scales based on the combo result (e.g. more hits = more damage).
 * 4. Ends ability — combo manager resets the combo count and allows the player to start a new chain.
